### Why I built with React and TailwindCss

This project is my second porfilo. My first one was built with Vanilla Html/Javascript. As I built it with vanilla, it became frusturated with the organization. I was overwhelmed with the design and functions that I realized I wanted to do too much. So I stopped, worked on smaller projects and kept learning - including React. 


Once I learned the basics of React and Tailwind, I knew I could start building my Portfolio again. Components gave organization that I seeked and well Tailwind allow me to drop Classes and not endure endless CSS scrolling. 



#### What I learned 

1. Using plugins like emailJs for form emails. 

- EmailJs gave me the power to get my email form live. It took a brieft lesson to understand the code and how to setup my form. I am happy with the result. 


2. React-Use-Form 




3. Datapassing
