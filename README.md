My process
I decided to use only HTML and css. No frames to test my speed. Since the project is simple, I avoid to use classes in my css.

Built with
Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Flexbox
CSS Grid
Mobile-first workflow
What I learned
This was a great way for me to practice timing myself and coding faster, with better code. This project took about 1.5 hours to complete. Improvement is happening!
